The One True Makefile project is hereby placed in the public domain
(with the exception of the tinyxml module), although if you found the
One True Makefile project useful as a template or example, it would be
nice if you could mention that fact in your project's README file
and/or documentation.  (But acknowledgement is not any kind of
requirement, since this project is in the public domain.)

TinyXML was written by Lee Thomason, and is licensed under the quite
permissive zlib license.  Please see
http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxmldocs/index.html for details.  (If
you don't want to include TinyXML in your projects, it's trivial to
remove from the One True Makefile project.)

If this COPYING file is included with another project besides the One
True Makefile project, then what probably happened is that the author
used the One True Makefile project as a template, but forgot to modify
this COPYING file.  In that case, you should probably assume their
source code is not in the public domain.
